# DMR
Deep Match to Rank Model for Personalized Click-Through Rate Prediction

This code for DMR is implemented based on the Alimama Dataset (https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=56), references the codes of DIEN (https://github.com/mouna99/dien).

"alimama_sampled.txt" is a sampled dataset for testing the code.

Notice that, the user behavior data in this dataset contains only category, brand and behavior type, but no item.
